Description: Schema-driven protocol fuzzer
 FluxProbe is a lightweight, schema-driven protocol fuzzer that generates
 a mix of valid and intentionally corrupted frames for testing network
 protocols against devices under test.
 .
 Features include:
  * Declarative protocol schemas (YAML/JSON)
  * Structure-aware and byte-level mutation strategies
  * Multiple built-in protocol profiles (HTTP, DNS, MQTT, Modbus, etc.)
  * Pluggable TCP/UDP transports
  * Deterministic runs with seed support
  * Detailed logging with hexdump output
